This is not the real app of a real shop
I created this repo just to learn the React.js library

## Technologies used
React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## How to run
1. First, download the code and unpack/unzip it
2. Then, open the terminal and change the directory to unzipped folder
3. install node-modules by entering: ``` npm install ``` in command prompt
4. run: ``` npm run dev ``` in terminal to start the server
5. press `o` and `Enter` to open it in your browser
